A Project made by 7 Students at the HAW Hamburg for their Module "Projekt C"

Game Idea:
The Player needs to build and expand their city but if the citizens requirements are not met, they can riot.
A riot is visible through the change of clothes of one of the citizens and the one burning building after a sabotage.

The Player then needs to morph into a npc's pov, go up to the house and extinguish it or else the building will be destroyed.

Goal of the Game is to fulfill one of the predefined win conditions
