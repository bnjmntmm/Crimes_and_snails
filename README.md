The Player needs to build and expand their city but if the citizens requirements are not met, they can riot.
A riot is visible through the change of clothes of one of the citizens and the one burning building after a sabotage.

The Player then needs to morph into a npc's pov, go up to the house and extinguish it or else the building will be destroyed.
Goal of the Game is to fulfill one of the predefined win conditions 


# How to play
Start the Game and press "Start", after that select one of the Win Conditions.

To move around you move the mouse to the edges, zoom is with mousewheel
Interaction with Buildings, NPC's and UI are done with Leftclick.

# Known Bugs
- Sometimes the first NPC is not able to reach a resource, only fix is to restart the game
- Sometimes the camera switch is not working properly -> You get stuck in the POV View of a NPC but cant control etc.
